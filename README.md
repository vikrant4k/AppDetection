# AppDetection

## About
This is an app made by two students at the University of Amsterdam used for the course Project AI. The purpose of
this app is to collect data on which app the user used when, and eventually use AI techniques to predict what app the
user will open next. As of now we have a very raw alpha version of the app, and the goal is to eventually have a 
nice user interface where the most likely apps are shown to the user. 
The data collected will only be used for research purposes. 
[More information can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJVTQhSDp-7_7NJsT6z8BZuqR41wSltXwpf5GCpU8PY/edit?usp=sharing)

The app is currently only available for designated testers. If you would like to be one of
the testers of our app, simply send an email to one of us (the contributors in this repo) and we will add you to 
the list of testers and send you an invite link to the Play Store. You can also contact `appdetectionai@gmail.com`.

## Install instructions

2. Once you have successfully signed up and agreed to the terms and conditions
, you will get an Android pop up saying 
`Allow AppDetection to access this device's location?`

4. Once you have allowed usage access, press the back arrow to go back, and back once more to go to the app.
You should now be successfully logged in, and presented with a screen thanking you for logging in. 

5. You are now done! You can hit the back arrow once more to close the app, as it will now be running in the background
collecting data. We have made app so that it only updates when the screen is on, and only every two seconds in
order to minimize power consumption. We will
only collect data every 24 hours, so network usage should also be minimal.
If the app shuts down for some reason, please reopen it. You should still be logged in and will not have to do anything else.

Thank you for installing AppDetection and helping us. The data collected will only be used for research
purposes.
